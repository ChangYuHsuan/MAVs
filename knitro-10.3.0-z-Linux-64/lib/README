Linking KNITRO 10.3 Libraries for 64-bit Linux
----------------------------------------------

This directory contains the 64-bit Linux Artelys Knitro libraries.
The Knitro 10.3 libraries for 64-bit Linux implement parallel features 
using OpenMP.  These libraries are built so that they are compatible 
with gcc 4.4 and glibc 2.5. In order to use these libraries, you must
have a newer installation of Linux that is compatible for linking
against these libraries.

If you have an older installation of Linux that is not compatible
with these libraries, then you can use the older libraries provided
in the "sequential" subdirectory.  These libraries DO NOT use OpenMP
and thus do not implement any of the parallel features in Knitro. The
"sequential" libraries are built so that they are compatible with gcc 4.1.

If you are unable to link against both of these libraries, then
please contact your Knitro distributor to see if they can provide a
version of Knitro for 64-bit Linux that is compatible with your
system.
